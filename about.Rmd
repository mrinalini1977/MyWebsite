With a bachelors degree in Statistics, Economics and Pol.science and a masters in Computer science, it has been my dream to work on inter-disciplinary research. Data science has given me that opportunity. My primary focus is on using data scinece for development research and social good.  I also provide statistical support for Epidemiological and Social Science research.

I primarily use R for analysis.I have a solid background in database technologies (oracle, MySQL), analysis softwares (R, Base SAS and Microsoft Excel) and visualization tools (D3.js). I also have strong understanding of standard descriptive and inferential statistics (t-tests, ANOVA, regression), classification algorithms (decision tree and clustering) and Time series Modelling (exponential smoothing, ARIMA).

I previously worked for Accenture as a Java programmer and technical lead for 7 years.
